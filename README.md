# WeatherForecastApp

## Requirements:
*Creating a server-side application using the Spring framework (Spring Boot) that serves the user with historical (past week) weather data from a public API (https://open-meteo.com). The server should expose an endpoint accepting longitude and latitude coordinates. The returned information should include the average precipitation for a given day and the sunrise/sunset time. The application should also persist the timestamp and endpoint invocation parameters in a relational database.*


### To run the application in developer mode, you need:

1. To have Docker installed. The application will automatically download and launch properly configured images required for the application to run.
